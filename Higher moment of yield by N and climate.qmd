# Introduction

Accurate nitrogen ($N$) use is crucial for maximizing crop yields and profitability under variable climate conditions. Understanding how $N$ affects yield distribution is essential for agricultural policy, especially under climate variability. Traditional analysis focuses on mean yield, but this overlooks yield variability and higher-order moments, which are critical for understanding the risk associated with nitrogen application.

# Literature Review
## Higher Moments of Yield
Studies in agricultural economics show that focusing on only the mean yield effect is limiting. Literature on higher-order moments (e.g., variance, skewness) suggests that these moments provide insights into yield risk, crucial for risk-averse decision-making (Antle, 1983).

## Crop Yield Insurance and Nitrogen Use
In crop insurance, nitrogen is often considered as a factor in yield stability. Literature indicates that nitrogen can either mitigate or amplify risks associated with weather variability, with direct implications for insurance schemes.

# Research Objectives
The primary objective of this research is to evaluate whether $N$ application is yield-increasing or yield-decreasing under different climate conditions, particularly focusing on how $N$ affects not only mean yield but also the variance and higher moments of yield under the different weather events.

# Methodology

## Data Structuring and Panel Data Creation

Our dataset consists of approximately 100 on-farm trials with variable nitrogen rates, seeding rates, and climate conditions. 

### Potential problem of making combined panel data

- Heterogeneity: Differences in soil, climate, and management practices across trials.

- Non-Panel Structure: This dataset is not inherently structured as a panel, which poses challenges.

- Solution: Using fixed effects to control for unobserved heterogeneity. Additionally, create a pseudo-panel by aggregating trial-level data into consistent nitrogen, climate, and yield variables.

## Yield Response and Moment Estimation

- Estimate yield response to nitrogen using machine learning models to capture non-linear relationships. 


- Estimate moments ( first and higher ) 
$$
\mu_1 = E[Q] = m(x,\beta) E[e^u]
$$ {#eq-mean-yield}

Here, $m(x,\beta)$ represents the deterministic part of the yield response, which depends on inputs like nitrogen ($x$), while $E[e^u]$ represents the stochastic component.

- **Nitrogen (N)** and other inputs directly affect the deterministic part of the production function.
- The weather component ($e^u$) influences variability in yield outcomes, reflecting production risk.

The variance of yield can be expressed as:

$$
\mu_2 = E[(Q - E(Q))^2] = m(x,\beta)^2 (E[e^{2u}] - E[e^u]^2)
$$ {#eq-variance-yield}

## Expected Output Moments and Their Relationship to Inputs

The moments of the probability distribution of output are represented by:

$$
\mu_1(x, \gamma_i) = \int Q f(Q|x) \, dQ
$$ {#eq-moment1}

$$
\mu_i(x, \gamma_i) = \int (Q - \mu_1)^i f(Q|x) \, dQ, \quad i > 2
$$ {#eq-momenti}

- $\mu_1(x, \gamma_i)$ is the first moment (mean yield), and $\mu_i(x, \gamma_i)$ represents higher moments.
- This approach allows for **heteroskedasticity** (variance depending on $x$) and **heteroskewness** (skewness depending on $x$), providing a more flexible representation of yield distributions under different input conditions.


## Empirical Model for regressino of  Yield Moments to inputs and weather
The empirical model is:

$$
y_{it}^j = \alpha_{ij} + \beta_{j1} \text{low}_{it} + \beta_{j2} \text{S}_{it} + \beta_{j3} \text{N}_{it} + \beta_{j4} P_{it} + \beta_{j5} P^2_{it}+ \beta_{j6} G_{it}^2 + \beta_{j7} \text{N*P}_{it} +
\beta_{j8} t + \beta_{j9} t^2 + \epsilon_{ijt}
$$

- $\alpha_{ij}$ is a fixed effect for field and moment.
- $p_{it}$  capture precipitation and its quadratic effect.
- $t$ and $t^2$ are time trend variables.
